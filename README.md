# scrumboard

Software development and engineering projects are often developed using agile methodologies such as Scrum in computer science. As part of Scrum-based projects, there is a Scrum Board (image below), which collects information about the User Stories and Taks related to the project (for example, status, assignments, progress, etc.) Risk mitigation. To facilitate the development of projects based on Scrum, the Scrum Board system provides a standard backend for scrum boards.

User Stories that must be implemented

**US1:** I, as a User, would like to have access in the system to a user's CRUD, from full name, username and email information. - Only the user himself can carry out operations in his registration

**US2:** I, as a User, would like to have access in the system to a user's CRUD, from full name, username and email information. - Only the user himself can carry out operations in his registration

**US3:** I, as a Scrum Master, would like to have access in the system to a CRUD of projects, based on project name, description and partner institution information. - The Scrum Master is automatically associated with the project created in the role of scrum master

**US4:** I, as a Scrum Master, would like to have access to roles that can be assumed by users associated with projects. - The roles available must be: product owner, researcher, developer and intern

**US5:** I, as a Scrum Master, would like to associate a user registered in the system with a given project, specifying the role assumed by the user in the project - It is only possible for the Scrum Master to associate users with a project of which he is a part

**US6:** I, as a Scrum Master, would like to have access to development stages in projects created in the system. Each User Store in the project will be associated with a development stage. - The available stages must be: TODO, Work in Progress, To Verify and Done

**US7:** I, as a User, would like to have access in the system to a CRUD of User Stories, from the title and description information of the user story. - Users can only perform operations on user stories of projects they are a part of. - Every user story created belongs to the TODO development

**US8:** I, as a User, would like to be able to assign myself to a particular user story as one of the possible people responsible for its development. - More than one user can be associated with the same user story - Only users with researcher, developer or intern roles can join a user story

**US9:** I, as a Scrum Master, would like to be able to assign a certain user story to a user associated with the project. - Only users with researcher, developer or intern roles can be assigned to a user story

**US10:** I, as a User, would like to have access in the system to a CRUD of Tasks, from title information, task description and associated user story. - Only the Scrum Master or users assigned to the user story associated with a task can perform operations on the task in question - Every task created has the status of not performed

**US11:** I, as a User, would like to mark a Task as done - Only the Scrum Master or users assigned to the user story associated with a task can mark the task as done - Only tasks with status of not done can be marked as done

**US12:** I, as a User, would like to be able to move a certain user story from the Work in Progress stage to the To Verify stage. - Only user stories in the Work in Progess stage can be moved to To Verify - Only the Scrum Master or users assigned to the user story can move it to the To Verify stage

**US13:** I, as a Scrum Master, would like to be able to move a given user story from the To Verify stage to the Done stage. - Only user stories in the To Verify stage can be moved to Done - Only Scrum Master can change user stories stage in To Verify to Done

**US14:** I, as responsible for the Scrum Board, would like the system to perform automatic changes in the development stage of registered user stories.
Changes must be made after the following events: - TODO for Work in Progress: whenever a user story is assigned to a user associated with the project - Work in Progress for To Verify: whenever all tasks in a user story are marked as done

**US15:** I, as a User, would like to be able to be interested in a User Story in development, to be notified with each user story update - The notification must be represented as a message in the application's terminal, indicating who is receiving the notification and the reason for this - Updates of interest to a user story are: description change and stage change

**US16:** I, as a Scrum Master, would like to receive notifications for each User Story update performed on the system - The notification must be represented as a message in the application's terminal, indicating who is receiving the notification and the reason for this - Updates of interest to a user story are: description change, stage change and task marked as done

**US17:** I, as a Product Owner, would like to receive notifications for each user story completed in the system (marked as Done) - The notification must be represented as a message in the application's terminal, indicating who is receiving the notification and the reason for this

**US19:** I, as a User, would like to have access to descriptive reports on the status of the user stories developed to which I am assigned. It should be described in the report: - The percentage and total number of user stories that are attributed to the user - The percentage and number of user stories assigned to the user at each stage of development

**US20:** As a Product Owner, I would like to have access to descriptive reports on the status of user stories developed throughout the project. It should be described in the report: - The percentage and number of user stories at each stage of development

**US21:** As a Scrum Master, I would like to have access to descriptive reports on the status of user stories developed throughout the project, with details of the users' performance.
It should be described in the report: - The percentage and total number of user stories that are assigned to each user - The percentage and number of user stories assigned to each user at each stage of development - The percentage and number of user stories at each stage of development
